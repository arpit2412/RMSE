inal research paper, usually related to the previously submitted research proposal (but could be unrelated).

Note that the production of the research paper is a hurdle requirement. You must achieve at least 40% of the marks for the research paper and a passing grade overall to pass.

Submissions must be formatted according to the ACM template available at https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template, following the sigconf style. You can use LaTeX or Word to prepare the submissions, but the final submission has to be in pdf. Submissions must be between 6 and 10 pages long, including all references and appendices.

A typical paper structure would be the following -- but feel free to deviate from this if it doesn't seem to fit your research project well.

Abstract - executive (roughly 150 word) summary of the entire paper (2 marks)
I. Introduction - what is the research project about? (2 marks)
II. Motivation - why is this topic important? (2 marks)
III. Background - what background knowledge do we need to understand the research? (2 marks)
IV. Research Method - introducing research questions and methods for data collection and analysis
IV.A Research Questions - what is your research question / are your research questions? (3 marks)
IV.B Data Collection - what data did you collect (describe in enough detail that somebody else could reproduce)? (5 marks)
IV.C Data Analysis - how did you analyse this data (describe in enough detail that somebody else could reproduce)? (5 marks)
V. Findings - what did you find, i.e., what is the answer to your research question(s)? (3 marks)
VI. Discussion - how do you interpret the findings? This is where you can speculate a bit. (2 marks)
VII. Threats to Validity - what threats affect the validity of your findings? (7 marks)
VIII. Related Work - how does your research fit in with other researchers' work? (3 marks)
IX. Conclusions - a quick summary and concluding remarks (2 marks)
X. Future Work - what should others do next based on your work? (2 marks)
References - at least 15 references would probably be good
