Team presentations of selected papers will be done via video submissions and can be done in teams of 1 to 6 students (i.e., you are allowed to work on this by yourself). 


Topic Selected: Ethical issues in Empirical Software Engineering

All submitted videos will be made available to all students after submission, and every team (i.e., at least one student per team) should comment on at least one other video.

Each team will present a paper from this list: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbdL5wuForoZ8ll0xpKWjKhRBqJdrIHf_StChIWg7MiCjbfQ/viewform (Links to an external site.). The presentations will be marked based on

    summary of the paper (4 points)
    critical review of the paper (4 points)
    comment on other video (2 points)


The form asks you for your name(s) and student number(s), which video you're giving feedback on, and what your feedback is. I expect at least one paragraph, and feel free to mention something positive as well as something that you think could be improved.
